<h1>Divide By Area</h1>

<p><img src="../img/divide-by-area-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Divides a polygon in predefined areas. Useful to create parcels of specific area on a street blocks.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Division</strong></p>

<p>Needs a boundary polygon as well as a list of sqm-values to divide polygon. The algorithm creates step by step new polygons inside the boundary with the specified areas. However, there are multiple options to add a polygon, since it can be created at each side of the boundary. The algorithm tests each option and chooses the best one according to its evaluation criteria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the evaluation criteria the outcome can have different results. I.e. a criteria can be, that the edges of the new polygons always try to align to a given direction, leading to a more linear parcellation. Another criteria could choose the area with the widest width, the result often looks like a rose.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Application</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fast parcellation of street blocks. Narrow street blocks can be easily subdivided in exact areas, providing a fair distribution of parcels. Wider street blocks can be subdivided, too, but not every parcel might have access to streets. A combination with <a href="">Slicing Tree Module</a> is possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Area is in control, but the resulting shape of the parcels can be unsatisfying, because they might be too narrow or not attached to the boundary polygon.</li>
</ul>
