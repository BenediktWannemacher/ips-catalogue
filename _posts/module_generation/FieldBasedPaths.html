<p>Paths grow in the direction of an underlying vector field similar to a magnetic field. The resulting paths are not always straight and more comparable to naturally grown streets.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide a vector field or derive date from grey-scale image.</p></li>
<li><p>Set starting point from where street should grow.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>Field-based paths are i.e. used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=min5Cz587hw">CityEngine</a>.
By changing the direction 90° perpendicular segments can start from paths. Combining multiple field-based paths, grid-like structures can be created, but the grid deforms and orients itself to the field.</p>

<p>The underlying vector field can be derived i.e. from the terrain, resulting paths might take the steepest path.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Difficult to control destination of paths.</li>
</ul>
