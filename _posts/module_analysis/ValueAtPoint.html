<h1>Value At Point</h1>

<p><img src="../img/value-at-point-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Evaluates an object such as bitmap or mesh at a specific point for a specific value.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Find relative coordinate of a point on an object such as a mesh or bitmap and get the value such as Normal-Vector or RGB-Value at position.</p>

<h2>Application</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A grid of points can be overlaid onto a mesh of a terrain. By getting the normal of the mesh at each point position, the slope of the terrain can be evaluated.</p></li>
<li><p>A basemap of i.e. land uses can be evaluated at specific locations for its color. If the color matches a specific land use, the land use can be assigned to the point.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Quality of evaluation depends on the resolution of the object being evaluated.</li>
</ul>
