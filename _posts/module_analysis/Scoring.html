<h1>Scoring</h1>

<p>Compares numbers of a dataset with preferred number and derives a score from difference.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Basic scoring:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set preferred number</p></li>
<li><p>Compare preferred number to each number of a dataset by subtraction.</p>

<p>The resulting subtracted number can be used as a score with high numbers as high score and low numbers as low score.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Absolute Values:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If there is no difference between the distance of numbers smaller or higher than the preferred number, choose the absolute/positive value: </p>

<p>-1 has same distance to 0 as 1. Both can get the same value of 1, if it is not of importance.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remapping Values:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mapping: Take the smallest and highest calculated numbers as minimum and maximum values. Define a new minimum and maximum value and map all numbers within this range:</p>

<p>Mapped Number = Minimum New + (Number - Minimum Old) * (Maximum New - Maximum Old) / (Maximum New - Minimum New)</p></li>
<li><p>Easing: With an easing function number can not only be mapped linearly. Functions can be i.e. f(1/number). A function can be drawn on a graph with the x-axis representing the calculated numbers and a y-axis representing the new values. By taking a value on the x-axis a value on the y-axis can be derived through the function.
(Easing functions are common in animation software and web development and <a href="https://easings.net">well documented</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Application</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Residential areas might need to be build close to the city center. The distance to the center can be calculated. A basic scoring would give close locations a low number and far away places a high number. Low numbers would represent good values.</p></li>
<li><p>If high numbers would be needed as good values, the numbers can be remapped: A distance of 0m would get a score of 1 a distance of 3000m and above would  get a score of 0.</p></li>
<li><p>If very close areas are preferred, an easing function such as a cubic-bezier could rate close number higher.</p></li>
</ul>
