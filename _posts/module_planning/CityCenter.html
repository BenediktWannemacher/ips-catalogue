<h1>City Center</h1>

<h2>Location</h2>

<p>The city center is elemental to a city, some even have more than one. It serves main public needs and provides public space. Therefore, its location can be specified early on in the city development process. Its location can be placed within <a href="">Land Use Distribution</a>, but also manually assisted by <a href="">Evaluation Score</a> or through i.e. <a href="">Force-based Distribution</a>.</p>

<p>If a street network already exists in the phase of planning, it can be analysed through <a href="">Street Analysis - Movement To</a> to identify the possible location of the city center.</p>

<p>Otherwise the street network should grow around the city center and keep it as its most integrated spot.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can be kept close to primary roads for fast access.</p>

<p><strong>Close</strong> entities get <strong>high</strong> score (Combine <a href="">DistanceTo</a>, <a href="">StreetAnalysis - Movement To</a> and <a href="">Scoring</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
