<h1>Sub Center</h1>

<h2>Location</h2>

<p>Sub center can be an elemental part of a city, serving public needs and providing public spaces. Therefore, its location can be specified early on in the city development process. Its location can be placed within <a href="">Land Use Distribution</a>, but also manually assisted by <a href="">Evaluation Score</a> or through i.e. <a href="">Force-based Distribution</a>.</p>

<p>If a street network already exists in the phase of planning, it can be analysed through <a href="">Street Analysis - Movement To</a> to identify hotspots in the city. Setting a radius of travelling distance such as for <a href="">Pedestrians</a> allows to place sub centers in walkable distance.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can be kept close to primary and secondary roads for fast access.</p>

<p><strong>Close</strong> entities get <strong>high</strong> score (Combine <a href="">DistanceTo</a>, <a href="">StreetAnalysis - Movement To</a> and <a href="">Scoring</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
