<h1>Pedestrian Movement</h1>

<p>Supply a walking distance radius (~300 m) to <a href="">Street Through Movement</a> to see which street are potentially used more frequently by pedestrians or, to <a href="">Street To Movement</a> to see where people might meet.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="">Slope</a>: 1 to 35%, on intersections &lt; 6%</li>
<li>Pedestrian lanes should have a minimum width of 6m</li>
<li>Storm drainage should be done with 2.5% slope</li>
<li>Avoid street perpendicular aligned to <a href="">Water Flow Direction</a> for reasons of flooding.</li>
<li>Should be protected from vehicular lanes by 15-20cm elevation</li>
<li>If vehicles drive nearly walking speed, a visual separation of lanes through pavement is possible (shared surface)</li>
</ul>
