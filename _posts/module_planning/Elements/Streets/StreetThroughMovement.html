<h1>Street - Through Movement (Betweenness)</h1>

<ul>
<li>Provide street segments for <a href="">Line Segment Network Analysis</a></li>
<li>Add potential weights for point of interests</li>
<li>Analyse betweenness centrality to find out which streets are the main arteries for transportation.</li>
<li>Adjust the calculation radius to find potential <a href="">Pedestrian movement</a> (radius of 300m), <a href="">Cyclist movement</a> (radius of 700m) or <a href="">Car movement</a> no radius limit.</li>
</ul>
