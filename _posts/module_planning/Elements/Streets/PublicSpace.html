<h1>Public Space</h1>

<p>Normally public space is all space belonging to the municipality in legal terms. However, it can also be related to places for gathering and pubilc activities. Therefore, in form of <a href="">Public Squares</a> it can be integral part of <a href="">City Center</a> or <a href="">Sub Center</a> as well as other places such as <a href="">Open Market</a>.
A combination of <a href="">Street Movement Through</a> and <a href="">Street Movement To</a> can show viable locations for frequently used public spaces and therefore, can be recommendable for public functions and services.</p>
